# Delivery Time Prediction - Porter Orders

## 📋 Overview
This repository contains the complete regression modeling and analysis for predicting delivery times of Porter orders.  
The objective is to accurately estimate delivery duration based on operational features such as distance, order complexity, and dasher availability, thereby supporting better planning and operational efficiency.

The analysis includes:
- Feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Linear regression modeling
- Coefficient interpretation
- Residual diagnostics
- Operational insights based on model findings
